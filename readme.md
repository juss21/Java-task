 * Unix console for the bash script 

### How to run
* #### Use the processTransactions bash script:    
  ``bash processTransactions.sh [path-to-user-file] [path-to-transaction-file] [path-to-bins-file] [new-file-path1] [new-file-path2]``

* #### Use Java commands:    
  ``javac *.java`` - Compile all java files before running

  ``java TransactionProcessorSample.java [path-to-user-file] [path-to-transaction-file] [path-to-bins-file] [new-file-path1] [new-file-path2]``

### Quick note 

This is my first ever Java project. Luckily for me, the syntax felt similiar to other programming languages I know. To showcase what I can do, I didn't use any AI.    
There are probably ways to improve the code or maybe something isn't working correctly, so I'd love to get some feedback. I really enjoyed this task and coding in Java, so I hope to learn more and kickstart my career with you guys!
